/* The Web Playback SDK: this tab registers itself as a Spotify device, so we
 * can play whole tracks instead of 30s iTunes previews.
 *
 * Why the SDK rather than remote-controlling an already-open Spotify client:
 * the SDK *pushes* state (`player_state_changed`) and `seek`/`togglePlay` are
 * local calls, so a precise scrubber costs nothing. Remote control would mean
 * polling `GET /me/player` forever against the shared dev-mode quota bucket.
 *
 * Starting a track is still one Web API call (`playTrackOnDevice`) — one per
 * track change, which is the same order as the preview lookups it replaces.
 *
 * Requires Premium and a browser with EME/Widevine. Both failures surface as
 * SDK error events, which is why the caller gets a status + message. */
